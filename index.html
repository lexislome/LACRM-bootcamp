        <p>Thanks for coming to my site. Here you'll find some information about me, and some blog posts I've written about various interests of mine. Hope you enjoy!</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Lexi. I'm a junior at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm majoring in linguistics and psychology with the intention of going to graduate school for linguistics after I finish my bachelor's degree. I'm currently learning to code as part of a summer fellowship, and I'm coding this blog for practice. Outside of school and work, some of my interests include running, reading, crafting, cooking, and baking.</p>
